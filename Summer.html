        <p>Beginning of Summer, the seventh solar term of a year, signals the transition of seasons. On this day, the sun's rays reach an angle of 45 degrees to the earth. The temperature will rise quickly during this period, yet in northern China weather remains mild, not tropical.</p>

        <p>Grain buds is the eighth solar term of the year. It means that the seeds from the grain are becoming full but are not ripe. During the Grain Buds period, the summer harvest is about to begin. Because of the great increase in rainfall, rivers are full of water, which makes fish and shrimp big and fat. It is also harvest season for fishermen.</p>

        <p>Grain in ear is the ninth solar term of a year. The arrival of Grain in Ear signifies the ripening of crops such as barley and wheat. It is also a busy period for farmers. Rainfall increases during Grain in Ear compared to the previous eight solar terms. Regions in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are about to enter the Plum Rains season.</p>

        <p>Summer solstice is the tenth solar term of a year. At this time, much of the northern hemisphere receives the most hours of daylight, but it does not bring the hottest temperatures which will come only 20 to 30 days later. On the Summer Solstice itself, daylight lasts the longest for the whole year in the northern hemisphere. After this day, daylight hours get shorter and shorter and temperatures become higher in the northern hemisphere.</p>

        <p>Minor heat, the 11th solar term of a year, signifies that the hottest weather is coming, but temperature has yet reached its peak point. The hottest time of a year are often observed after minor heat ends. Storm, thunder and hail are common during minor heat, though in some years there might be droughts. One of the prevailing farming activities during minor heat is staying on top of flood control and drought relief.</p>

        <p>Major heat is the 12th solar term of a year. During Major Heat, most parts of China enter the hottest season of the year. During Major Heat, the sunshine, high temperatures, and heavy rainfall are good for agricultural crops. But like Minor Heat, many natural calamities such as floods, droughts and typhoons also happen during Major Heat. Therefore, it’s important to harvest and plant in time to avoid setbacks caused by natural disasters.</p>
