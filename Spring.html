        <p>Beginning of Spring, the first solar term of a year, lifts the curtain of spring. After that everything turns green and full of vigor; people clearly see that the daytime is becoming longer and the weather is becoming warmer.</p>

        <p>Rain water, the second solar term of a year, signals a gradually warmer climate with less snow and more rain. A saying goes: "Spring rain is as precious as oil". Rain in spring is crucial for the growth of crops. Some dry areas depend heavily on spring rain to assure a year worth of harvest.</p>

        <p>Awakening of insects, the third solar term of a year, signals the end of hibernation for insects. Awakening of insects, as the name suggests, refers to insects waking after hibernation, most often by the sound of thunder in spring, or so people in ancient China believed. In fact, it is not thunder that stirs the insects, but the rising temperature and ground temperature. Most of the China will enter a season for spring farming.</p>

        <p>Spring equinox, the fourth solar term of a year, signals we have reached halfway through spring. Spring equinox divides the spring season, usually 90 days, in equal halves. It also is a day when the duration of day and night are 12 hours each, to the exact. The duration of the day also begins to be longer than night after spring equinox.</p>

        <p>Pure brightness begins on the day of Qingming Festival. Qingming is the most important day of sacrifice in China. It is a day to pay respects to the ancestors. Cold Food Festival is an ancient Chinese festival. On this day, only cold dishes are served (making fire is prohibited) and tombs are visited. This coincides with customs of Qingming Festival, and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably.</p>

        <p>Grain rain is the sixth of the 24 solar terms in the Chinese lunar calendar. It is also the last solar term of the spring, which heralds the arrival of a lively summer. Grain rain is an important period for the growth of grains. The ancient Chinese concluded a long time ago that as Guyu comes, the weather will become warm enough for sowing. As the proverb goes, "the rain feeds all grains".</p>
