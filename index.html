        <p>More than 2,000 years ago, ancient Chinese people created an overall framework to mark the annual passage of timebased on observations of thesun's motion, called "The 24 Solar Terms".</p>
        <p>In the international meteorological field, the 24 solar terms are hailed as "the fifth great invention of China". In 2016, the 24 solar terms were included in the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>
        <p>The 24 solar terms are Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, Awakening of Insects, Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, Beginning of Summer, Grain Buds, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, Minor Heat, Major Heat, Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, White Dew, Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost's Descent, Beginning of Winter, Minor Snow, Major Snow, Winter Solstice, Minor Cold and Major Cold.</p>
        <p>Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice are the two days of the year with the longest and shortest amount of daylight respectively, while Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox are days with the most balanced amount of daytime and nighttime. Through these four points, a year is divided into four parts: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.</p>
        <p>In ancient times, this system not only guided agricultrual production, instructing farmers to expect the changes in temperature, spring planting and autumn harvest, but also directed Chinese customs. Nowadays, the 24 solar terms could not only be applied to farming, but also guide Chinese in everyday life. They remind people to adapt to the changes in the seasons through suitable foods and cultural rituals.</p>
